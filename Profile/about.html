    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am a driven, enthusiastic, fun-loving guy with a passion for anything high tech.  I was born
        in Ontario, Canada and moved to Virgina with my parents when I was 10.  Since I was a child playing with my Nintendo, and various other consoles,
        I have had an interest in how things work. My parents would buy me some new gadget and within a day I would have it taken apart and had made an attempt to put it back together.
        I was very lucky to have access to a computer when I was very young and was exposed to new technology on a regular basis.

    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I very recently moved to the Redmond, WA area to start my career in programming and
        web development.  I hope to meet some like minded people through various meet-up groups to help in my development process
        and to hopefully play music with.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   I am a music lover at heart, I love to play, write and listen to many types and genres of music.
        I was in a band in Florida for 5 years called <a href= "http://www.machinegunfunkband.com" class = "about-links">Machine Gun Funk</a>.  We toured around Florida
        and the neighboring states for a few years and put out two records, one was a self titled live EP and the other was called "Homeland Obscurity".
        We recorded with an excellent producer, Kevin Pandele, at <a href ="http://www.thedamageroom.com/" class = "about-links">Damage Room Studios</a>. I decided to leave
        the band to be closer to my family in Maine and help them through a difficult time but I hope to find some talented people to work with here in Seattle.
